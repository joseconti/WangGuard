If you use a plugin or custom registration page, once you've installed WangGuard, test if it works. if it doesn't work, talk with the plugin developer or with your developer to make it compatible or use the standard WordPress, WordPress Multisite, BuddyPress or bbPress 2.0 signup form.

= Introduction to WangGuard: =


[wpvideo RGdn6YSg]



It is very important to use WangGuard at least for a week, reporting your site's unwanted users as sploggers from the Users panel.

WangGuard will learn at that time to protect your site from sploggers in a much more effective way.

WangGuard protects each web site in a personalized way using information provided by Administrators who report sploggers world-wide, that's why it's very important that you report your sploggers to WangGuard.

The longer you use WangGuard, the more effective it will become.

Upon user registration, WangGuard will check against a centralized database if the user is a Splogger or spam-user. If WangGuard determines that the user is a Splogger, WangGuard won't allow the registration on your site.

No need to put any kind of filter in the user registration page (eg captcha). This is the greatness of WangGuard, not hinder users who wish to register on your site with Captchas and other things that just makes the registration being more difficult and in many cases do not stop Sploggers. But in case you want to put something WangGuard gives you the ability to add one or more security questions from the plugin's administration page, which will be randomly displayed on the registration page.
